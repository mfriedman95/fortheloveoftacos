Molly’s Carnitas
Needs:
1 pork butt/ pork shoulder (~10 lbs)
Pork Lard
4-5 oranges
2-4 limes
2-3 white onions
2-4 poblanos
2-3 jalapenos 
1 tablespoon Mexican oregano
2-3 tablespoons smoked paprika
2-3 tablespoons garlic powder
Salt
Pepper

Break down pork butt/shoulder into large chunks about 4-6 inches each. Coat each chunk liberally with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and Mexican oregano. Place pork in a roasting pan with plenty of room between each large chunk. Quarter onions (save ¼ onion for later), poblanos and jalapenos and place in pan between pork pieces (number of peppers will vary based on individual taste). Juice oranges and lemons into pan and leave fruit halves between pork pieces as well (number of fruits will depend on sizes and taste). Pour rendered lard (cooled and still liquid) into pan with other ingredients until fluid reaches 1/3 - 2/3 up the pork butt/shoulder pieces. Bake at 300-350F for 4-8 hrs depending on time constraints and heat setting. Pull pork pieces (falling apart) out of pan with peppers and onions and place on your favorite warm tortillas. Serve with chopped onions, cilantro and salsa verde (or whichever tacos toppings you prefer).
